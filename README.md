# Basic-Scrapy-Webcrawler

*This was created in a short few day period for the purposes of a Job Interview for a Junior Developer role*

This is a basic webcrawler that utilises the Scrapy Python framework designed to collect data from the Premier League site. It has a functioning command line interface which provides a simple menu of features. 

### Options
The following are the main features of the data parsing:
    
1) "View the current Premier League Table."
2) "View a teams record."
3) "View a teams PPG over the course of the season."
4) "View the team placements over the course of the season."
5) "Compare two team's statistics."




This project can be ran in the command line by executing `Main.py`
